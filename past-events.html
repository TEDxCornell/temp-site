<h1>Past Events: Spread Ideas Worth Spreading</h1>

<p>TEDxCornell is dedicated to making ideas worth spreading heard. Currently, the TEDxCornell Talks event is held every academic year. Passionate and thoughtful speakers from the Cornell community and beyond come together and tell their stories in hopes of enlightening the Cornell audience. Furthermore, TEDxCornell keeps introducing new ways of communication and idea spreading. For example, the virtual salon series in 2021 enables the audience to interact more closely with the speakers.</p>

<h2>2021: Uproot</h2>

<h3>Virtual Salon Series</h3>

<p>During the '20-'21 school year, the TEDxCornell team shifted to a series of virtual events instead of our usual singular main event. The virtual series included two Salon events which were smaller but more interactive, discussion-based events. The virtual format allowed for participants to ask our speakers questions and engage with their talks through different activities. The series was concluded by a virtual main event.</p>

<h3>TEDxCornell Talks</h3>

<p>On May 2nd, 2021, we hosted six speakers from our Cornell community and beyond to share ideas that would educate, entertain, and inspire. Our speakers discussed topics ranging from today's most important social issues to using psychedelic-assisted therapy to treat PTSD. The event was held on live stream to allow flexibility for our speakers and audience during the pandemic.</p>

<p>In the midst of the pandemic, we were forced to introspect and reevaluate ourselves, our communities, and the world around us. With the challenges that we face come great opportunities for growth and change. Our 2020 speakers addressed our most pressing social issues, shared groundbreaking and hope-inspiring research, dug deep to share their personal stories, and inspired us to reflect on what opportunities lie where we least expect them.</p>

Breakfall proved to be a transferable skill in her career as a three-time entrepreneur, disrupting the American prison industry. Cat works with gang leaders in the most notorious prisons, leading gang intervention programs. She has survived career-ending threats and devastating takedowns. Seth Godin published her best-selling book, A Second Chance: For You, For Me, and for the Rest of Us.

He spent his next 18 years in prison, heavily entrenched in gang culture. Prison officials labeled him as “the worst of the worst” and locked him in a notorious supermax prison, Pelican Bay. John transformed his life and now works with gang leaders to stop the generational cycle of gang violence nationally. Together, they’ve authored the first-ever retirement plan for gang members, called Squaring Up. With Hustle 2.0, John has co-authored 10 books that provide rehabilitation and healing for people in jails and prisons nationally.</p>
