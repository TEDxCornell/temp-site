# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This contract is a _living_ document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Contract

Your team contract should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.

1. To what goals do we all commit?

    - Submit every milestone on time as no slip days can be used for this project.
    - Hopefully make a four-page website of good quality, according to the goals of the client and the audience.


2. What are our "ground rules"? (Don't make an exhaustive listâ€”stick with just a few.)

    **Tip:** Interrupting another person can make them feel like their option isn't valued. Consider a rule about interrupting.

    - Check the group chat frequently.
    - Finish own tasks on time or let the other members know the progress.
    - Don't be a free rider.
    - Don't disappear right before the deadline.
    - Start early.


3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    - Group chat
    - Zoom / in-person meetings (maybe every week)


4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    - Group chat and in-person meetings
    - Listen to them carefully.
    - Seriously consider their needs and advice.


5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**No "coder" or "designer" roles are permitted;** everyone must design and code.)

    **Tip:** It's often helpful to think of **responsibilities** rather than roles here.

    - Every member is responsible for a webpage (from design to coding).
    - Every member should look at other's work and give advice.
    - Every member should ensure that their page is in a style consistent to the whole website.

    <!-- Source: project requirement -->
    - Everyone must contribute to user research, design, and planning.
    - Everyone must code HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    - Everyone must participate in user testing.
    - Everyone must have an opportunity to interact with the client (most likely in meetings).


6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    - Distribute tasks to each member and set up deadlines for ourselves. Every member should confirm that the deadlines are reasonable and they are able to finish the tasks on time.
    - Ensure that the work is equally distributed in the first place.
    - If one cannot finish their task on time, they should communicate with the members about the difficulty and the estimated finishing time. Other members can help with the difficulty but NOT do their work for them.


7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    - When we disagree, be patient and talk.


8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    - Aftet the initial draft, the contract can be changed if everyone agrees.


9. What else do we want to include in this contract? Maybe you team needs a _fun_ clause...

    **Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

    - Don't be too stressful :(. Don't be too chill :).
    - Have some good sleep after completing each milestone.

## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the contract, please email the instructors at <info1300-prof@cornell.edu>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
