# Group Project: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.

## Client (Milestone 1)

### Client Description (Milestone 1)

> Tell us about your client. Who is your client?
> Explain why your client meets the client rules in the project requirements.

- TEDxCornell is a club at Cornell. It hosts annual speaking events and focuses on sharing new opinions and ideas.
- TEDxCornell meets our project requirements because the website is not made for any specific member on our team. TEDxCornell is a professional organization that has real needs and wants to have a redesigned website.

### Client Questionnaire (Milestone 1)

> Develop a client questionnaire to learn more about your client and their goals.
> You may use the questionnaire below, you may modify the questionnaire below, or you may create your own.

   - TEDxCornell is an organization dedicated to giving a platform to people with unique opinions
   - Is a student run organization located at Cornell University
   - Provides a voice to people who otherwise wouldn’t have one
   - Gathers a large variety of people

2. What makes your organization and its services special or unique?

   - Sponsored by the official TEDx
   - Sponsored by local companies

   - Wants to change from google forms to internal forms on the website
   - Wants improvements on the presentation of the website
   - Thinks presentation contribute a lot to the website (specifically appealing to viewer)

4. Who do you want to visit your site? Who do you believe is your website's intended audience?

   - Cornell students
   - Maybe attract speakers (professors …)

5. When visiting your site, what actions do you want your visitors to take?

   - Would like an “about” page
   - FAQ would be nice
   - Page on sponsorships
   - Some information on past events
   - How to apply to be on TEDxCornell page

6. What are your goals for this site?

   - To make the website and the organization look professional
   - To learn more about TEDxCornell
   - To attract speakers

7. Is there a "feel" that you want for your site? Are there colors or imagery that you have in mind?

   - More formal
   - Sharp contrast between the images and the white background
   - More formal and sophisticated font

8. What are your favorite competitors or similar organizations' websites? Why?

   - The official website TEDx: neat; efficient representation of information, look professional
   - Cornell Blockchain: background black and white, look professional

9. Besides the content of the existing site, what else do you want to add? Will you provide it to us?

   - New images for the website

### First Client Meeting Minutes/Notes (Milestone 1)

> Include your notes/minutes from your first meeting with your client.

- Meeting took roughly 15 minutes
- Attendees: all members and the client
- See notes above
- Main points:
  - Seemed to have wanted a more professional and formal website
  - Wanted to attract people who want to speak for TEDxCornell
  - Formal font
  - Contrasting images
  - Emphasis on wanting a forms page
  - Focus on design and presentation

### Client Website (Milestone 1)

NOTE: after meeting with the client, we discussed and wrote the rationale together.

> Tell us about the website that your client wants.
> Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.
> Note: **If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site.** (FireFox makes it easy to take a full screenshot of a page from the context menu (right click).)
> If you are redesigning an existing site, tell us how you plan to update the site in a significant way that meets the project's requirements.

- Our client wants a more formal and professional look to his website. For this project I think it would be best to have a plain white background, with contrasting images, and with a more formal font like sans serif. The purpose of this website is to attract potential speakers for TEDxCornell and for viewers to learn more about what TEDxCornell is all about. We are planning to add more content to the existing website and potentially upgrade the presentation of it. We also want to add more images and change the organization of the current pages to make it more readable and appealing to the viewer.

### Client Goals (Milestone 1)

> Identify your client's goals for the website.
> What kind of website do they want? What are their goals for the site?
> There is no required number of goals. You need as many goals as necessary to reflect your client's desires.

- To build up a general impression on the audience about TEDxCornell (professional)
- To learn more about TEDxCornell (the organization and events)
- To attract speakers

### Client Website Scope (Milestone 1)

> We want your project to be successful! It needs to be ambitious, but not too large.
> A good rule-of-thumb is that you should have about 1 content-full page for each team member.
> Explain why the website you will create for your client isn't too small and isn't too big.
> Explain why you think it's the right size for this project.

- Most of the content will be recycled from the existing website, which has substantial content. The client also asked us to add more content like images. So the website will not be small.
- We will focus on making our content concise and thorough for our viewers. We will also decide which content should not be included if it does not meet the audience's goals. So the website does not get too big.
- As planned, each member will work on one page. We will make the content for each page about the same.

## Plan/Schedule (Milestone 1)

> Make a plan of when you will complete all parts of this assignment.
> This plan is for your team. There is no required format. Format it so that it works for you!
> Your plan should include when you will interview users and analyze their goals.
> Your plan should also include how and when you will assemble/create the sit's content.
> **Tip:** Your team should plan to work ahead. This project really isn't feasible to complete the night before a deadline.

- We aim to complete all milestones on time.
- Week 1: Complete user interviews and website goals.
- Week 2: Complete skeleton code (layout, code organization, etc.)
- Week 3: Fill in pages with content and add styles
- Week 4: Add interactivity

## Understanding Users (Milestone 2)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality, but it doesn't have to be fancy.

### User Interview Questions (Milestone 2)

> Plan the user interview which you'll use to identify the goals of your site's audience.
> You may use the interview template below and revise it as much as you desire.

**User Interview Briefing & Consent:** "Hi, I am a student at Cornell University. I'm currently taking a class on web design and for a project, I am designing the website for TedxCornell. I'm trying to learn more about the people that might use this site. May I ask you a few questions? It will take about 10 minutes. You are free to quit at any time."

1. Please tell me a bit about yourself. You may omit any personal or private information.

2. Recall the last time you visited a club website, does the website design affect your opinion of the club.

3. Have you visited a well-designed website that looked fine on a desktop but not on mobile? How did it affect your opinion of the the club?

4. Recall the last time you visited any website, were there any features that made the website more accessible, such as a hamburger burger?

...

n. What haven't I asked you today that you think would be valuable for me to know?

**After the interview:** "This was really helpful. Thank you so much for agreeing to speak with me today. Have a great day!"

### Interview Notes (Milestone 2)

> Interview at least 1 person for every member of your team from your audience.
> Take notes and include those notes here. Make sure to include a brief description of each interviewee.
> **Copy the interview questions above into each interviewee section below.**
> Take notes for each participant inline with the questions.

**Interviewee 1:**

Monica Lee is a second-year student at Cornell; she is a transfer from Boston College. She is part of TEDxCornell.

1. Please tell me a bit about yourself. You may omit any personal or private information.
   Hi, I'm a speaker curation member at TEDxCornell. (After asking year and major) I'm a sophomore, and I am currently a Hotelie.
2. Recall the last time you visited a club website, does the website design affect your opinion of the club.
   I think first impressions do matter. If I saw a website that wasn't well-put together it would give me the impression that the club isn't organized or professional. On the other hand, seeing a great website does make me believe a club is well-run.
3. Have you visited a well-designed website that looked fine on a desktop but not on mobile? How did it affect your opinion of the the club?
   Sometimes, I run across this. It really depends on how bad it is. Usually some overlapping text is OK, but ideally it would not be there.
4. Recall the last time you visited any website, were there any features that made the website more accessible, such as a hamburger burger?
   I think giving feedback when a user submit forms could help.
