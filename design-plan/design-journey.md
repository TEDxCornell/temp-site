# Group Project: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.

## Client (Milestone 1)

### Client Description (Milestone 1)

> Tell us about your client. Who is your client?
> Explain why your client meets the client rules in the project requirements.

- TEDxCornell is a club at Cornell. It hosts annual speaking events and focuses on sharing new opinions and ideas.
- TEDxCornell meets our project requirements because the website is not made for any specific member on our team. TEDxCornell is a professional organization that has real needs and wants to have a redesigned website.

### Client Questionnaire (Milestone 1)

5. When visiting your site, what actions do you want your visitors to take?

   - Would like an “about” page
   - FAQ would be nice
   - Page on sponsorships
   - Some information on past events
   - How to apply to be on TEDxCornell page

6. What are your goals for this site?

   - To make the website and the organization look professional
   - To learn more about TEDxCornell
   - To attract speakers

7. Is there a "feel" that you want for your site? Are there colors or imagery that you have in mind?

   - More professional website
   - More formal
   - Sharp contrast between the images and the white background
   - More formal and sophisticated font

8. What are your favorite competitors or similar organizations' websites? Why?

   - The official website TEDx: neat; efficient representation of information, look professional
   - Cornell Blockchain: background black and white, look professional

9. Besides the content of the existing site, what else do you want to add? Will you provide it to us?

   - New images for the website

### First Client Meeting Minutes/Notes (Milestone 1)

> Include your notes/minutes from your first meeting with your client.

- Meeting took roughly 15 minutes
- Attendees: all members and the client
- See notes above
- Main points:
  - Seemed to have wanted a more professional and formal website
  - Wanted to attract people who want to speak for TEDxCornell
  - Formal font
  - Contrasting images
  - Emphasis on wanting a forms page
  - Focus on design and presentation

### Client Website (Milestone 1)

NOTE: after meeting with the client, we discussed and wrote the rationale together.

> Tell us about the website that your client wants.
> Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.
> Note: **If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site.** (FireFox makes it easy to take a full screenshot of a page from the context menu (right click).)
> If you are redesigning an existing site, tell us how you plan to update the site in a significant way that meets the project's requirements.

- Our client wants a more formal and professional look to his website. For this project I think it would be best to have a plain white background, with contrasting images, and with a more formal font like sans serif. The purpose of this website is to attract potential speakers for TEDxCornell and for viewers to learn more about what TEDxCornell is all about. We are planning to add more content to the existing website and potentially upgrade the presentation of it. We also want to add more images and change the organization of the current pages to make it more readable and appealing to the viewer.
- https://www.tedxcornell.com/team <- Current website link for TEDxCornell

### Client Goals (Milestone 1)

> Identify your client's goals for the website.
> What kind of website do they want? What are their goals for the site?
> There is no required number of goals. You need as many goals as necessary to reflect your client's desires.

- To build up a general impression on the audience about TEDxCornell (professional)
- To learn more about TEDxCornell (the organization and events)
- To attract speakers

### Client Website Scope (Milestone 1)

> We want your project to be successful! It needs to be ambitious, but not too large.
> A good rule-of-thumb is that you should have about 1 content-full page for each team member.
> Explain why the website you will create for your client isn't too small and isn't too big.
> Explain why you think it's the right size for this project.

- Most of the content will be recycled from the existing website, which has substantial content. The client also asked us to add more content like images. So the website will not be small.
- We will focus on making our content concise and thorough for our viewers. We will also decide which content should not be included if it does not meet the audience's goals. So the website does not get too big.
- As planned, each member will work on one page. We will make the content for each page about the same.

## Plan/Schedule (Milestone 1)

> Make a plan of when you will complete all parts of this assignment.
> This plan is for your team. There is no required format. Format it so that it works for you!
> Your plan should include when you will interview users and analyze their goals.
> Your plan should also include how and when you will assemble/create the sit's content.
> **Tip:** Your team should plan to work ahead. This project really isn't feasible to complete the night before a deadline.

- We aim to complete all milestones on time.
- Week 1: Complete user interviews and website goals.
- Week 2: Complete skeleton code (layout, code organization, etc.)
- Week 3: Fill in pages with content and add styles
- Week 4: Add interactivity

## Understanding Users (Milestone 2)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality, but it doesn't have to be fancy.

   - Alex, junior from california. Studying PAM

2. Recall the last time you visited a club website, does the website design affect your opinion of the club.

   - It does affect his opinion. If the club has a bad website, the club is portrayed in a negative light. It makes him less inclined to apply.

3. Have you visited a well-designed website that looked fine on a desktop but not on mobile? How did it affect your opinion of the the club?

   - It does not matter too much. This is annoying but doesn't matter to much as he understands why it is difficult to put desktop on a phone.

4. Recall the last time you visited any website, were there any features that made the website more accessible, such as a hamburger burger?

   - Not in particular. If the website is well organized, that is always more beneficial. Drop down menu in top corners are better.

### Goals (Milestone 2)

> Analyze your audience's goals from your notes above.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1 and probably more than 2).

Goal 1: Find sufficient information about the club TEDxCornell in general (their story, people, and events)

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - We will design our website with sufficient content that is easy to see on the main pages of ther websites. We will include all relevant information about logistics of the club, general information, and specific frequently asked questions.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - People come to this website to learn more about what the club is in general and decide if it is a good fit for them, thus they would likely want lots of information about the club.

Goal 2: Easily access information about club via website.

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Information should easy to find. We will put all main content in the middle of pages with accurate labels and design choices that group similar information together. We will also make the navbar easy to follow.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - People come to this website to look for information about the club or speakers but it wouldn't be good for users if all this information is hard to find. Therefore it is our goal to make the information easily accessible and intuitive.

Goal 3: Be able to Apply to the Club or become a speaker

To do this, we will have easy to see buttons for information about applying to the club or speaker. These will be on main pages and are a primary goal for users because they come to this website to learn about the club and apply to the club.

### Audience (Milestone 2)

> Briefly explain your site's audience.
> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group with regard to your website.

My site audience is everyone (normally Cornell Students) interested in applying to TedX Cornell Club via our website. This is one group of all people affiliated with cornell looking to apply to the club or be a speaker.

## Website Design Exploration (Milestone 2)

Identify three websites (preferably static websites) that exist today on the web to draw inspiration from. Please select websites that are similar to the website you wish to create.

Include two screenshots of the home page for each site: narrow and wide.

**We'll refer to these are your "example websites."**

1. [Cornell Blockchain Link](https://cornellblockchain.org/)

   ![Cornell Blockchain Wide Screen](cornell-blockchain.png)

   ![Cornell Blockchain Narrow Screen](cornell-blockchain-narrow.png)

2. [Cornell Hedgefund Link](https://www.cornellhedgefund.org/)

   ![Cornell Hedgefund Wide Screen](cornell-hedgefund.png)

   ![Cornell Hedgefund Narrow Screen](cornell-hedgefund-narrow.png)

3. [Cornell Consulting Link](https://www.cornellconsultingclub.org/)

   ![Cornell Consulting Wide Screen](cornell-consulting.png)

   ![Cornell Consulting Narrow Screen](cornell-consulting-narrow.png)

### Example Website 1 Review (Milestone 2)

> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

I think Cornell Blockchain does a great job at segmenting their information, and implementing a clean, professional design (white background, strong contrasts, sharp edges, and sans-serif font). Some interactivity features I noticed were, a hamburger navigation menu when the screen collapses into a narrower screen and darkening icons on clickable elements.

### Example Website 2 Review (Milestone 2)

> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

I think Cornell Hedgefund also does a great job at separating their information and ultilizing a professional design. Furthermore, unlike Cornell Blockchain, their website theme is consistent across multiple webpages. I especially like their use of hero images, and professional color scheme (white, navy blue, and gray). Their website also makes excellent use of a hamburger dropdown menu on smaller screens, and icon darkening when hovering over clickable elements.

### Example Website 3 Review (Milestone 2)

> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

I think Cornell Consulting does a great job at implementing a sleek, professional theme, just like the previous two websites: white background, sans-serif font, sharp edges, etc. They also implement a hamburger burger and icon darkening. There are dropdown menus nested inside the hamburger menu. Some page names have a "+" beside them, indicating that a dropdown menu will appear if one of the sections is clicked.

## Content Planning (Milestone 2)

Plan your site's content.

### Your Site's Planned Content (Milestone 2)

> List **all** the content you plan to include your website.
> You should list all types of content you planned to include (i.e. text, photos, images, etc.)

- Past speaking events with photos
- Team member photos and brief descriptions
- Application information (including applying to be a speaker, nominating a speaker, and applying to be a club member)
- History of TedxCornell
- Mission Statement
- Purpose and introduction to the club
- Entry to join the mailing list

### Content Justification (Milestone 2)

> Explain (about a paragraph) why this content is the right content for your site's audience and how the content addresses their goals.

These content decisions satisfy our audience's goals by giving our audience the information they need to learn more about TEDxCornell and the information they need to apply if they want to. The past speaker events are essential for giving users some idea about what type of events TEDxCornell hosts. Introducing group members on the website makes the club look active and mature, also implying what kind of students would fit into the club for visitors who want to apply.

## Information Architecture (Milestone 2)

### Content Organization (Milestone 2)

> Document your **iterations** of card sorting here. You must have at least 2 iterations of card sorting.
> Include photographic evidence of each iteration of card sorting **and** description of your thought process for each iteration.
> Please physically sort cards; please don't try and do this digitally.

![CartSort 1](cardsort1.jpg)
In my first card sort, I had four sections focusing on 1) learning about TedXCornell, 2) learning about past events and what TedXCorenll is currently doing, 3) how to get connected with TedxCornell, and 4) other information on TedxCornell. In the first section, I started out thinking that I needed an about me section. This would serve as an introduction to the club. I also thought it would be more informative if the history was put next to the introduction, along with the mission statement, purpose, and socials. For my next section, I realized that I should put all content about events in one blob together. Having videos of past events, information on past speakers, annual events that might be hosted, and perhaps videos of the event themselves. Next, everything I thought that would relate to connecting with tedxcornell was put in a blob together. I put together a mailing list, information on how to become part of tedxcornell, how to become a speaker, and an excerpt encouraging people to join TedxCornell. Lastly, all information that I thought wouldn't fit in the other sections were put together. I thought that users would want to have an information section. I started knowing we wanted an FAQ content space. After that I knew there would be questions on the location of tedxcornell, how to get involved, and general questions on the event itself.

![CartSort 2](cardsort2.jpg)
My second cardsort builds off my original cardsort with different iterations. Instead I put the mailing  list in the first section rather than having it in the social section. I thought that people may want to join the mailing list after reading the about me section. Instead of putting information on how to get involved in the last section, I put it in the 3rd section which all seemed to focus on connecting with TedxCornell. Lastly, I added a post it on how to get information on the speakers and the expereience.

### Final Content Organization (Milestone 2)

> Which iteration of card sorting will you use for your website?

We are planning on using card iteration 2.

> Explain how the final organization of content is appropriate for your site's audiences.

Card iteration 2 makes more sense in terms of familiarity and convenience. Switching the mailing list to the first section would make it easier for our users to quickly subscribe to the mailing list without having to search for it. It also makes more sense chronologically since the majority of websites have the mailing list on the first pafe where it is easily seen. Additionally I think it makes more sense to have an "how to get more involved" statement in the section where they are encouraging users to join TedxCornell. Lastly, I thought that all information that fell outside the realm of the beginning sections should belong on an FAQ or information page. This includes information that speakers, cornellians, or outsiders may want to know.

UPDATES: Later we decided to replace the "Apply" page with "Our Story." We plan to put information about application on the home page and other sections. For example, we will have an entry on the Past Events page in case the audience want to apply to be a speaker after reading about past events. It is unnecessary to make a page only for application. Some of the content initially on the home page will be put on Our Story. The home page becomes more concise so that the audience don't get impatient reading through it.

### Navigation (Milestone 2)

> Please list the pages you will include in your website's navigation.

- Home
- Past Events
- Our Story
- Frequently Asked Questions

> Explain why the names of these pages make sense for your site's audience.

These are appropriate names for our sites, because our home page will have general information, past events will house past event content, our story page will be about the history of the club and members, and frequently asked questions will contain common questions that our target audience might have.

## Visual Theme (Milestone 2)

> Discuss several (more than two) ideas about styling your site's theme. Explain why the theme ideas are appropriate for your target audiences. Note the theme you selected for your site and why it's appropriate for the audience and their goals.

Our first theme idea is professional: white background, muted red, gray, and black, sans-serif font, sharp edges, and sparingly use of drop shadows. We believe that this theme is appropriate because it follows what many would expect from a "business website": conservative colors with simple but decisive design choices. We believe this theme could be appropriate because it gives off strong first impressions to our audience.

Another theme idea we had was a more "future" theme, as TEDxCornell has a focus on creating ideas oriented towards "new" ideas. This would include more "futuristic" banners and hero images, perhaps with a monospace font. We believe this theme could be appropriate because it suits the brand that TEDxCornell tries to portray.

Our last theme idea was a more club-like theme, slightly less uptight than the professional theme. We believe this theme could be appropriate because at the end of the day, TEDxCornell is a student organization.

## Design (Milestone 2)

Document your site's layout.

## Interactivity Brainstorm (Milestone 2)

> Using the audience goals you identified, brainstorm possible options for interactivity to enhance the functionality of the site while also assisting the audience with their goals.
> Briefly explain idea each idea and provide a brief rationale for how the interactivity enhances the site's functionality for the audience.
> Note: You may find it easier to sketch for brainstorming. That's fine too. Do whatever you need to do to explore your ideas.

- Hamburger menu on narrower screens: A hamburger menu save space on narrow screens. It makes the website more clean and organized, which echoes back to our professional theme. It also helps the audience find the information they want as quickly as possible.
- Button darkening on mouse hover: When a button is hovered over, the color of the button will darken. This is to provide feedback to the audience's actions and to tell them clicking on that element will trigger interactivity.
- Dropdown answer in the FAQ page: The audience always go to the FAQ page with a question already in mind. The question title is the most important identifier of whether they can find what they want in this page. Hiding the answers initially lets users focus on the questions and browse them through. After that, they can simply leave (if nothing found) or click the question to see the answer. This interactivity blocks other content in the page that might be unnecessary for the audience.
- A slideshow which automatically advances for the lineup of speakers in the Past Event page. Currently, the photos of speakers and their topics take up a lot of spaces. These can be made a slideshow, where each slide introduces a speaker. The audience can change the slides by themselves, and the slides also alternate automatically after several seconds.

### Layout Exploration (Milestone 2)

> Iterate on your site's design through sketching.
> Sketch both the narrow and wide versions of the site.
> Here you are just exploring your layout ideas. You don't need to sketch every page.
> Include some of your interactivity ideas in your sketches.
> Provide an explanation for each sketch explaining the idea and the design patterns you are leveraging.

![homepage](/design-plan/homepagedesign.png)
![homepage with dropmenu](/design-plan/homepagedesigndropmenu.png)
![FAQ](/design-plan/homepageFAQ.png)
![mobile](/design-plan/mobile1.png)

In this design, I focused on a more clean and professional look. The decided on using a gray background color for the navigation and the header. I thought having a gray top would make it stand out against the white background. I also thought it make more sense since the TEDxCornell logo has white and red colors, so naturally the font should be white. After that I incorporated some of the interactivity such as the carousel, dropdown menu, and the accordion for the desktop. For the mobile design, I stuck with the same design pattern but created a white hamburger menu at the top left. The font will be smooth which the images will have sharp corners. I chose to have contrasting colors to compliment the background.


![desktop](/design-plan/homepage2.png)
![mobile](/design-plan/mobile2.png)

For my second design I still wanted to stay with the clean and professional look. I made alterations on where I wanted to have my slider and where I wanted my colors. I changed my header color to white which I thought would fit in with the white background. I then wanted to direct attention to the middle of the page so I made one half a slider and the other half have a gray background. Since dark gray and white are complimentary to each other it will stick out against the background. In that gray area I wanted to have the "About Us" introductary paragraph. Having a design like this will quickly grab the audiences attention while also showing them pictures of what TEDxCornell does


### Final Design (Milestone 2)

> Include the final sketches for each of your pages.
> **Include your final interactivity in your sketches.** Include annotations to explain what happens when the user takes an action with your interactivity.
> The sketches must include enough detail that another 1300 student could implement them.
> However, you don't need to provide layout/CSS annotations.
> Please, provide an explanation for each sketch.

**Wide Design:**


![final design mobile](/design-plan/finaldesignmobile.png)

For the mobile design, you would need a div class for the top, so class= container. Here you would center the logo at the middle and have button called "hamburger". After this, you need a carousel under it, so you would need a carousel class and 3 images with a class and individual ids. After this, you would have the written section under it using headings and paragraphs.

![final design faq](/design-plan/FaqGP.JPG)
This is relatively the same on both narrow and wide views with possible exeptions of the navigation but overall all looks the same. In the final Design of the FAQ page, there is a page title/header, then a blurb about the details of the page. Lastly, the main content of the pages are sets of question and answers of common questions and answers. When the users click different pages it takes them accordingly. There is not much interactivity on this page.

<<<<<<< HEAD
![Past Events final - wide](past-events-wide.jpg)
(The slideshow is explained later with mobile sketches.) On wider screens, images and text can be put in row. For example, the description and photo of a speaker are now side by side so that the audience can glance through more information at a time. However, white spacing is still important, and the main content only makes up 70% of the window width. Such design helps establish the professional tone.


**Narrow Design:**
=======
**Wide (Wide) Design:**

For the desktop, there needs to be a div container for the top. I would call that a class "container". Here you would need the logo img on the right, and then the nav, li, ul, a on the right. For the CSS, you would make the font family sans-serif, display the whole thing as a flex, make it a row flex-direction, and float the nav to the left. I also thought it would be beneficial if you could hover and make it red.
After that there would have to be a div container for the entire middle, I called the class "middle". You would need a class for the carousel, so class= "carousel". Here there would be 3 images and buttons for the arrows ans dots. The images would have individual IDs. After this you would need a div class for the written section, so class is "written". You would need to make class= "middle" a flex, so display flex and flex direction is row. You would make the written section flex is a column. After this you should use the javascript snippets from class for the carousel.

This is relatively the same on both narrow and wide views with possible exeptions of the navigation but overall all looks the same. In the final Design of the FAQ page, there is a page title/header, then a blurb about the details of the page. Lastly, the main content of the pages are sets of question and answers of common questions and answers. When the users click different pages it takes them accordingly. There is not much interactivity on this page.

The layout comforms to the conventional pattern for narrow screens -- text and images are put in columns. Alignment is also important, because slight misalignments can make the audience think that the club is not professional enough. To maximize usability (and to shorten the page), two slideshows are implemented on the page. This pattern is different from the original website where all the speaker descriptions and photos are listed in columns. With the slideshow, the audience don't have to scroll down and down and down. There are three ways to alternate the slides so that the audience can trigger the interactivity efficiently.

### Design Rationale (Milestone 2)

> Explain why your design is appropriate for your audience.
> Specifically, why does your content organization, navigation, and site design/layout meet the goals of your users?
> How did you employ **design patterns** to improve the familiarity of the site for your audience?

I decided to choose design 2 since I thought it fit in more with the theme of formal and professional. On the desktop interface, the navigation would be to the very left while the header would be to the very right. This employs a very famiiar design making it quick and easy for the users to get comfortable with the website. I also thought that having sharp edges what give a more clean look to my website. However, since the website is directed at potential speakers and students of Cornell, I thought it would be better to have a smoother font like sans-serif. This would make it more inviting and approachable for the user. Additionally, for the mobile screen, there is a hamburger menu at the top left. This consistant with how the majority of websites are built. The colros I chose (gray, black, red, and white), all create a professional look. The white background is a neutral background, the gray will be the secondary color, the black will be the font color, and the red will be the accent color. This content organization meets the goals of the users by making it simple, familiar, and easy to access. Users will know exactly where everything is since the design is consistant with the majority of websites.

## Interactivity Rationale (Milestone 2)

> Describe the purpose of your proposed interactivity.
> Provide a brief rationale explaining how your proposed interactivity addresses the goals of your site's audience and enhances their user experience.

- A hamburger menu on narrower screens will increase real estate for more essential content. It also lets the visitors know the structure of the website and locate their needed content efficiently.
- Nested dropdown menu in the main navbar enables the audience to get to a specific part of a page, which saves their time and makes the website look professional and organized.
- Button darkening when hovered over provides feedback efficiently to the audience's actions. This feature makes the website more usable and helps the audience accomplish their goals in general.
- The dropdown pattern in the FAQ page helps block other content that might be unnecessary for the audience so that they can quickly find what they want.
- The slideshow of speakers of past events saves space. The audience don't have to scroll down and down and down to see all the speakers but just click on the next or previous buttons.


## Interactivity Plan (Milestone 2)

> Now that you've designed your interactivity for your site, you need to plan how you will implement it.
> Describe how you will implement the interactivity. This should be a complete plan that another 1300 student could use to implement the interactivity.
> You should list the HTML elements, CSS classes, events, pseudocode, and the initial state.

1. Hamburger menu

CSS classes:

- hidden class

HTML elements:

- the list inside the navbar

Events:

- click listeners
- window resize

```
if window size grows smaller than 600px:
   hide the navigation bar and show the hamburger menu;

if the window size is smaller than 600px and the hamburger menu is clicked:
   show a navigation bar if the navigation bar is hidden; otherwise, hide the navigation bar

if window size is ever greater than 600px we show the default navigation bar
```

2. Buttons darken when hovered over

CSS classes:

- hover-background class

HTML elements:

- buttons

Events:

- hover listeners

```
if a mouse is hovering over a button element
   add the darkening background class to the button

if a mouse is no longer hovering over a button element
   remove the darkening background class to the button
```

3. Slideshow of speakers' information

CSS classes:

- hidden class
- slides class

HTML elements:

- units of speaker information (including the name, the topic, the description, and the photo); each unit in a div element and in a class of "slides"
- buttons: "previous" and "next"
- above the slideshow there is a list of speakers; each item in the list is also a button

Events:

- click an item in the list
- click the "previous" or "next" button
- timer (10 seconds)

```
If the current slide has been displayed for 10 seconds:
   show next slide.

If the previous button is clicked:
   show the previous slide of the current slide.

If the next button is clicked:
   show the next slide of the current slide.

If an item in the button list is clicked:
   jump to the slide indicated by the item.
```

4. Accordion in FAQ

CSS classes:

- hidden class

HTML elements:

- answers which are initially hidden
- questions as buttons

Events:

- click on a question

```
If a question is clicked:
   show the associated answer if it is currently hidden.
   hide the associated answer if it is currently displayed.
```

## Client Feedback & Minutes (Milestone 2)

> You should meet with your client again to obtain feedback on your design.
> Provide a summary of the client's feedback and your meeting's minutes.

OVerall, liked the addition of a dropmenu and a slider. They wanted the accordion to be bigger on the screen for the FAQ. They liked how we kept the original colors of TEDxCornell. They also added how they liked how we stuck to the theme of professional and formal.
