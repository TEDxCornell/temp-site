            TED is a nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks. TED began in
            1984
            as a conference where Technology, Entertainment, and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics --
            from science to business to global issues.

            A TEDx event is a local gathering where live TED-like talks and videos previously recorded at TED
            conferences
            are shared with the community. TEDx events are fully planned and coordinated independently, on a
