            What is TED?
        </button>
        <p class="answer hidden" id="TEDanswer1">
          TED is a nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks. TED began in 1984
          as a conference where Technology, Entertainment, and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics --
          from science to business to global issues.

          A TEDx event is a local gathering where live TED-like talks and videos previously recorded at TED conferences
          are shared with the community. TEDx events are fully planned and coordinated independently, on a
          community-by-community basis.
